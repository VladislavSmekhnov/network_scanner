# Network Scanner

This program tests the speed and quality of your Internet connection. After its work you can find a file 'internet_logs.txt'.
### This file will only be written to if your internet speed is less than 30 Mbit/s.

You may change it in test_connection.py on 48 line.

## To run on *nix-like OS-ms:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/VladislavSmekhnov/network_scanner.git
cd network_scanner/
chmod +x run.sh
```
And then to start the program:

./run.sh
```
